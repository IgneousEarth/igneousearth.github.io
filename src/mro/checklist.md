# Checklist

## Arrival

 1. [ ] **Log the level of the water tank**.  The water tank is located down the stairs heading toward the bedrooms, in the utility room on the right. The light to this room is (most inconveniently!) located on the left side of the doorway. Measure the water level by opening the valve to the gauge marked "in. H2O", which is located just above the water pump. The clear tubing will also match the level in the tank. 
	- Measure each day - refill if under 1/4 full. 
2.  **Prepare the water system**.  
	- [ ] Turn on the water pump with **circuit breaker 8** on panel **M**. 
	- [ ] Flush both toilets, which helps avoid the dreaded sewer backup! 
	- [ ] Check the level of the water tank on a daily basis so as to avoid the (also dreaded) low water alarm. 
		- Do **not** turn on the water heater.
3. [ ] **Prepare heat and air conditioning**. 
	1. If heat is needed - flip switch from 'Off' to 'Heat' on per-room basis.
	2. If AC needed, uncover the vents outside just north of the main entrance and turn on the AC circuit breaker.
4. [ ] **Add potable water to foot pump** - in kitchen, put the kitchen tube in one of the big blue water tanks.
5. [ ] **Initialize camera** - on Sleipnir the Slow, open Evora (`http://localhost/` on Sleip, or `http://72.233.250.83/` elsewhere on the network). 
	1. Initialize and set temperature to **-82° C**. 

See [Telescope Setup & Calibration](telescope_setup.md) for information on preparing the telescope for observation.
