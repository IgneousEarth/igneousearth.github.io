Drove into town to restock on coffee and cookies, some grocery items and to pick up some posterboard. Using [this Bahtinov mask generator](https://skeye.rocks/tools/mask/), I designed a focusing mask to use with the telescope:

Ruby and I taped together two of the posterboards, then we outlined the shape of the mask with some straight-edges and pens, and started cutting out sections using a utility knife.

Unfortunately, whether by cause of clouds or smoke, it's a starless night tonight - so no testing for now. We set Evora to do a large sequence of darks and mostly hung out for the evening.
