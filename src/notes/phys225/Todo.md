## This Week

> This week, I want to focus on school, mostly on PHYS 225. This will involve doing a good job on the homework assignment (ideally by taking good notes on chapters, understanding them, then doing well without referencing the cheat sheet), re-visiting old topics, doing the practice exam once I feel I'm prepped (Thursday?) and then tackling the final with confidence. This won't be to the exclusion of everything else, but should be the absolute primary focus overall. 

- [ ] Review missed McIntrye chapters up to the current version
- [ ] Re-visit Hamiltonians ... what are they?
- [ ] Do Homework 8
- [ ] Do practice exam
- [ ] Do final
