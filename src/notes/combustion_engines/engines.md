# Fundamentals

There are two main types of engines:
- Internal combustion engines (i.e. gasoline, diesel, turbine)
- External combustion engines (steam piston, steam turbine, Stirling)

Every engine has something called an 'efficiency' associated with it:

$$\eta = \frac{\text{energy delivered}}{\text{heat absorbed}} = \frac{Q_1-Q_2}{Q_1}$$

> $Q_1$ is the heat absorbed, or 'waste energy', whereas $\Delta Q=Q_1-Q_2$ is the work done on the driveshaft (useable energy delivered).
