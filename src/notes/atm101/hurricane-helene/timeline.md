**Sept. 17, 2024**: [National Hurricane Center highlights](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/xgtwo/gtwo_archive.php?current_issuance=202409172324&basin=atl&fdays=7) two regions of interest for the development of tropical cyclogenesis: one in the north Atlantic, one in the Caribbean. 
- *Tropical cyclogenesis* (warm-core cyclones) is the process by which a cyclone develops. 
	- *Tropical* is different from *temperate* (also extratropical) cyclogenesis, which are cold-core cyclones, waves along weather fronts.
	- Also *mesocyclones* which are warm cores over land (land hurricanes), generating tornadoes.
- Requires (see https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html): 
	1. Warm sea temps (min. 80 F, at least 50m deep)
	2. Atmospheric instability (strong adiabatic cooling), unstable to moist convection, often a consequence of thunderstorms.
	3. High humidity in low-to-mid levels of troposphere
	4. Enough Coriolis force to develop a low-pressure center
		- In this context, the CW Hadley cell (trade winds) and CCW Ferrel cell (westerlies) provide a "corridor" for hurricane development.
	5. Pre-existing surface "kickoff" disturbance, some initial conditions (like an existing spin) with sufficient vorticity and convergence.
	6. Low vertical wind shear (< 10 m/s) between surface and upper troposphere (i.e. surface & troposphere must be generally moving in same direction windwise). 
- **Note**: favorable conditions themselves do not appear to be enough themselves, see ([Velasco and Fritsch 1987](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqREF.html#V), [Chen and Frank 1993](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqREF.html#C), [Emanuel 1993](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqREF.html#E)), there likely is some other necessary condition. 

> The initial "kickoff" disturbance here seems to be the interaction of the [Central American gyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_gyre) with the [Madden-Julian oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden%E2%80%93Julian_oscillation)'s wet cycle.
>  The CAG is a weaker in terms of vortex/spin conditions but is *large* (hundreds of miles across), relatively stable and is most visible in May-June and Oct-Nov, meaning it happens both during periods of colder water and warmer. If sea temperatures continue to increase we may start to see more favorable conditions in May-June for hurricanes. 
>  The MJO propagates east -> west, and oscillates between "intense" and "suppressed" tropical rainfall (fulfilling the high humidity condition), over a period of 30-60 days (moves around 9-18 mph), i.e. 30-60 days of drier conditions, 30-60 of thunderstorms and rainfall. 

**Sept. 22**: Low-pressure environment became significantly larger (MJO and CAG coincidence), with thunderstorms and areas of intense rainfall becoming widespread in the Caribbean. 

Development was rapid: by [8:00 AM in the morning](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/xgtwo/gtwo_archive.php?current_issuance=202409221151&basin=atl&fdays=7), the chance for cyclone development was at 70%, by [8:00 PM](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/xgtwo/gtwo_archive.php?current_issuance=202409222322&basin=atl&fdays=7), the chance was raised to 80%. 

The relatively westward formation of the low-pressure zone (in the Central Caribbean as opposed to Eastern Caribbean) was particularly noticeable, as the Coriolis effect meant the predicted path of the region would likely coincide with high population density regions in the United States. 

**Sept. 23**: There [remained significant uncertainty](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al09/al092024.discus.001.shtml?) about the expected path and velocity of the low-pressure region due to the lack of a defined core, however the NHC declared such a core likely to emerge within the following day or two due to both historical precedent and hurricane models. 

The NHC announcement thus denoted the region 'Potential Tropical Cyclone 9' and provided a [prediction of location and wind intensities](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al09/al092024.discus.001.shtml?). 

Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters were expected to deploy to the area the following day. 

**Sept. 24**: The Hurricane Hunters and satellite data of the area indicated the presence of a formed warm-core by 12:00 UTC, and the low-pressure system was escalated to become a tropical cyclone termed 'Helene'. 

Notably, the [5:00 PM discussion](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al09/al092024.discus.006.shtml) had two items of particular relevance:
- The statistical-dynamical SHIPS/LGEM models indicated Helene was likely to achieve major hurricane intensity and sustain it until it reached Florida and continue inland.
- The hurricane *size* was quite notable: "Helene's forecast radii are at the 90th percentile of major hurricane size at similar latitudes, and therefore storm surge, wind, and rainfall impacts will likely extend well away from the center and outside the forecast cone, particularly on the east side."

**Sept 25**: The lack of "disruption" factors led to the extremely rapid continued development of the storm (vertical wind shear, other instabilities, widespread low-pressure area). The tropical storm was thus upgraded to hurricane levels at 10:00 AM CDT (see [this NHS discussion](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al09/al092024.discus.009.shtml)). 

Andrew Freedman [noted some interesting things](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/25/hurricane-helene-large-size-rapid-intensification) about this storm in particular, including that Hurricane Helene featured the *most rapid intensification* from a pre-named system to major hurricane on record. 

There were some further contributing factors to the rapid intensification, including:
1. Expected motion over an area of low vertical wind-shear
2. The Gulf of Mexico was particularly warm this summer, around ~86 deg F.
3. Strong mid-troposphere wind divergence (notable cyclonic conditions).

**Sept. 26**: Rapidly intensified from category 1 to category 2 by 8:00 EST, still in the Gulf, though strong storm surge conditions were noted on the Floridian and southeast US coast prior to the hurricane. 

By 14:00 EST, the hurricane reached category 3 intensities, and by 20:00 EST, the hurricane had intensified to category 4 with 140 mph sustained wind velocities at 939 mb of surface pressure, then made landfall in central Florida around 23:00 EST. 

The hurricane continued inland from the impact point, remaining intense over the seas, however began rapidly weakening as it moved over land. 

> "Helene continues to produce catastrophic winds that are now pushing into southern Georgia. This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation. Persons should not leave their shelters and remain in place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions.  When in the eye, people are reminded to not venture out in the relative calm, as hazardous winds will increase very quickly when the eye passes."

	**Sept. 27**: a [low to the northwest](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al09/al092024.discus.016.shtml?) of the hurricane's path encouraged the weakening hurricane northwest, however the weather system continued to degrade in the absence of notable convection (particularly from the ocean).

> ~80 deg F water has an incredible amount of latent heat. As the hurricane "sucks up" this water into the air, it will increase the energy of the hurricane as thermal energy transitions into kinetic. 
> Once over land *or* over colder water, this energy input is lost; instead, the storm is now 'heating up' cold water and land, and will rapidly lose energy. 

Helene weakened into category 2 while over central Georgia at 5:00 EST, then into a tropical cyclone by 14:00 EST while over Kentucky as the hurricane continued to lose energy in the absence of convection.

Helene finally dissipated in north-central Tennessee by 14:00 EST.
