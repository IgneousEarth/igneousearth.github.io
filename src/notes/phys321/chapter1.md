# Vectors

We start with a brief review of vector algebra - I'll skip most of it but keep the key things.

## Dot product

The **dot product** is a measure of how "parallel" two vectors are, maximized when parallel, minimized (0) when perpendicular.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\vec{a}\cdot \vec{b} &= a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3\\
	&= |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos\theta
\end{aligned}
$$

It is *commutative* ($\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = \vec{b}\cdot \vec{a}$) and *distributive* ($\vec{a}\cdot(\vec{b}+\vec{c}) = \vec{a}\cdot \vec{b} + \vec{a}\cdot\vec{c}$). The result of the dot product is a *scalar*.

## Cross product

The **cross product** yields a third vector orthogonal to both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, maximized in magnitude when $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are *themselves* orthogonal to one another.

![](images/chapter1/rhr.png)
The cross product is distributive, but not exactly commutative - instead,
$$
(\vec{b}\times \vec{a}) = -(\vec{a}\times\vec{b})
$$
Some other properties:
- The result of the cross product is a *vector*, not a scalar. 
- The *magnitude* of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram generated by $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. 
- The cross product of a vector with itself is zero.

We can calculate a cross product like so:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\vec{a}\times\vec{b} &= \left| \begin{matrix}
	\hat{x} & \hat{y} & \hat{z}\\
	a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\
	b_1 & b_2 & b_3
	\end{matrix}\right|\\
	&= |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\sin\theta\;\hat{n}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\hat{n}$ is the normal to the plane formed by $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. 

## Vector triple product

Triple products are combinations of cross and dot products.

1. **Scalar triple products**: the magnitude of this is the volume of the parallelepiped (3D parallelogram) generated by $\vec{a}$, $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
	\vec{a}\cdot(\vec{b}\times\vec{c}) &= \left| \begin{matrix}
	a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\
	b_1 & b_2 & b_3\\
	c_1 & c_2 & c_3
	\end{matrix}\right|\\
\end{aligned}
$$
![](images/chapter1/parallelepiped.png)

2. **Vector triple products**: there's no easy geometric interpretation of this, but is useful to reduce complex cross product calculations. It can be memorized by the mnemonic **BAC-CAB**. 
$$
\vec{a}\times(\vec{b}\times\vec{c}) = \vec{b}(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{c}) - \vec{c}(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b})
$$

## Spatial vectors

The **position vector** indicates the position of a point relative to the origin. 

![](images/chapter1/posvec.svg)
In electrodynamics, usually we'll have *two* points: one for the source charge and one for the test charge. The vector $\vec{\mathcal{R}}$ from one to the other is the useful quantity then.

# The Del Operator

Del ($\nabla$) is a **vector operator** that acts upon functions, and is defined as
$$
\nabla = \frac{d}{dx}\hat{x} + \frac{d}{dy}\hat{y} + \frac{d}{dz}\hat{z}
$$
$\nabla$ really only is meaningful when applied to functions, and has three (usual) ways of being applied:

1. To a *scalar function* ($\nabla f$) to get the **gradient** of that function.
2. To a *vector function* via the *dot product* ($\nabla \cdot \vec{a}$) to get that function's **divergence**.
3. To a *vector function* via the *cross product* ($\nabla \times \vec{a}$) to get that function's **curl**.
![](images/chapter1/grad-curl-div.png)
## Gradients

The **gradient** of some scalar function $f$ gives a vector result that will point in the direction of the max rate of increase of that function.

$$
\nabla f = \frac{df}{dx}\hat{x} + \frac{df}{dy}\hat{y} + \frac{df}{dz}\hat{z}
$$
and results in a *vector* with the derivative of the original function's units.

### Fundamental theorem for gradients

**Important**: The integral of a derivative (here, the gradient) is given by the value of the function at the boundaries $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$.
$$
\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} (\nabla T)\cdot d\vec{l} = T(\vec{b}) - T(\vec{a})
$$
## Divergence

The **divergence** of some vector function $\vec{a}$ represents how much the function "spreads out" or *diverges* from a given point.
$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{a} = \frac{da_x}{dx}+\frac{da_y}{dy} + \frac{da_z}{dz}
$$
and results in a *dimensionless scalar value* indicating the rate of divergence from a point.

### Green's theorem

Green's theorem is a special application of *Stoke's theorem* (see below). Geometrically, it relates the sources contained in some surface to the flux emitted by those sources around the boundary of a surface.
$$
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \vec{v}) \; d\tau = \oint_S \vec{v}\cdot d\vec{a}
$$
In the case of electrostatics, this might be the flux field generated by some charges in a volume to the total, superposition flux coming out of that entire region - turning one "field of charges" into a single charge.

> The integral of a **derivative** over some region will *always* be equal to the value of the function at the *boundary* ($P$) - in this case, the boundary term is an integral (a simple line may just have two endpoints, but a line bounding a volume forms a closed sufrface).
## Curl

The **curl** of some vector function $\vec{a}$ represents how much the function "swirls around" some given point. Positive curl is given by the right-hand rule (normally counterclockwise). 
$$
\nabla \times \vec{a} = \hat{x}\left(\frac{da_z}{dy} - \frac{da_y}{dz}\right) + \hat{y}\left(\frac{da_x}{dz} - \frac{da_z}{dx}\right) + \hat{z}\left(\frac{da_y}{dx} - \frac{da_x}{dy}\right)
$$
### Stokes' Theorem 

The integral of the curl over some surface is the "total amount of swirl" on that surface - and mathematically can be distilled into just finding *how much the flow* is following the boundary of that surface.
$$
\int_S (\nabla \times \vec{v})\cdot d\vec{a} = \oint_P \vec{v}\cdot d\vec{l}
$$
This last quantity, $\oint_P \vec{v}\cdot d\vec{l}$ is sometimes called the "circulation" of some vector field $\vec{v}$.

## A Note on Del Squared ($\nabla^2$)

Enumerating over the ways we can apply $\nabla$ twice:

1. **Laplacian**: the cross product of $\nabla$ with the gradient of a function results in the Laplacian, such that
$$
\nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = \nabla^2f= \frac{d^2f}{dx^2} + \frac{d^2f}{dy^2} + \frac{d^2z}{dz^2}
$$
2. **Curl of gradient**: always zero. 
$$
\nabla \times (\nabla f) = 0
$$
3. **Gradient of divergence**: not a lot of physical applications, calculable though. 
$$
\nabla (\nabla\cdot \vec{a})
$$
4. **Divergence of curl**: always zero. 
$$
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{v}) = 0
$$
5. **Curl of curl**: most easily defined as the acceleration of the swirl, like a hurricane speeding up.
$$
\nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{a}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec{a}) - \nabla^2\vec{a}
$$

# Integrals

In electrodynamics, we have **line** (path) integrals, **surface** integrals (or *flux*) and **volume** integrals. 

## Line integrals

Iterate over infinitesimally small displacement vectors $d\vec{l}$.
$$
\int_a^b \vec{a}\cdot d\vec{l}
$$
If $a=b$, the line integral iterates over a closed loop and we can write
$$
\oint \vec{a}\cdot d\vec{l}
$$
> In elementary physics, a common example is work done by a force. 
> $$ W = \int \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{l}$$

While path taken normally matters (distance), there are some vectors where only *displacement* matters (for forces, these are called **conservative** forces, like gravity). 

Wikipedia has a [really cool animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral) of line integrals:

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Line_integral_of_vector_field.gif)

</center>

## Surface integrals

Surface integrals iterate over infinitesimally small areas $d\vec{a}$, with norms perpendicular to the surface. 
$$
\int_{\mathcal{S}} \vec{v}\cdot d\vec{a}
$$
In this case, if the surface is closed (i.e. like a sphere, rather than a hill), then we can write it in closed loop form.
$$
\oint \vec{v}\cdot d\vec{a}
$$
![](images/chapter1/surface-integral.svg)

Surface integrals are really useful for things like *flux* where something is moving through some area - i.e. imagine radio waves passing through a curved gas cloud or radiation falling "through" a planet.

## Volume integrals

Volume integrals integrate over infinitesimally small volumes $d\tau=dx\;dy\;dz$. 

$$
\int \vec{a}\;d\tau = \int (a_x\hat{x}+a_y\hat{y}+a_z\hat{z})d\tau
$$

If some function $f(x,y,z)$ represented density of a substance, then the volume integral over it would be total mass.

# Integration by Parts

Also known as the "inverse product rule". 
$$
\int u\; dv = uv-\int v\;du
$$

# Curvilinear Coordinates

Taking another look at spherical and cylindrical coordinates, as well as how to convert between them. 

## Spherical coordinates

Three terms:
- $r$: the *distance* from the origin (range 0 to $\infty$)
- $\theta$: the *polar angle* from the $z$-axis (range 0 to $\pi$)
- $\phi$: the *azimuthal angle* along the $xy$-axis (range 0 to $2\pi$)
![](images/chapter1/3D_Spherical.svg.png)

$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= r\sin\theta\cos\phi\\
y &= r\sin\phi\sin\theta\\
z &= r\cos\theta
\end{aligned}
$$
Alternatively in terms of the unit vectors:

$$
\begin{align*}

\begin{bmatrix}

\hat{x} \\ \hat{y} \\ \hat{z}

\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}

\sin\theta\cos\phi & \cos\theta\cos\phi & -\sin\theta\\

\sin\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\\

\cos\theta & -\sin\phi & 0

\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}

\hat{r}\\

\hat{\theta}\\

\hat{\phi}

\end{bmatrix}

\end{align*}
$$
> The interesting thing about the matrix form is that it is *orthogonal* - according to the invertible matrix theorem, $Q^{-1}=Q^T$ for orthogonal matrices.

We can use this to solve for $\hat{r}$, $\hat{\theta}$ and $\hat{\phi}$ easily then by just taking the transpose of the above matrix. 

$$
\begin{align*}

\begin{bmatrix}

\hat{r}\\

\hat{\theta}\\

\hat{\phi}

\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}

\sin\theta\cos\phi & \sin\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\\

\cos\theta\cos\phi & \cos\theta\sin\phi & -\sin\theta\\

-\sin\theta & \cos\phi & 0

\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}

\hat{x} \\ \hat{y} \\ \hat{z}

\end{bmatrix}

\end{align*}
$$
Our line element in spherical coordinates is

$$
d\vec{l} = dr\hat{r}+rd\theta \hat{\theta} + r\sin\theta d\phi \hat{\phi}
$$

In terms of triple integrals, the textbook has a good graphic to represent the three displacements $dl_r, dl_\theta, dl_\phi$.

![](images/chapter1/spherical-infinitesimal.png)

And a infinitesimal volume element is the product of these three:

$$
d\tau = dl_rdl_\theta dl_\phi = r^2\sin\theta \;dr\;d\theta\;d\phi
$$
> $r$ has a possible range from 0 to $\infty$, $\theta$ from 0 to $\pi$ and $\phi$ from 0 to $2\pi$. 

> The textbook represents the spherical representations of the gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian in eqs. 1.70-1.73.

## Cylindrical coordinates

Three terms:

- $s$: *distance* from $z$-axis
- $\phi$: *azimuthal angle* along $xy$-axis
- $z$: *height* along z-axis

![](images/chapter1/cylindrical-coords.png)
$$
\begin{aligned}
	x &= s\cos\phi\\
	y &= s\sin\phi\\
	z &= z
\end{aligned}
$$
with unit vectors
$$
\begin{bmatrix}

\hat{x} \\ \hat{y} \\ \hat{z}

\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}

\cos\phi & -\sin\phi & 0\\

\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0\\

0 & 0 & 1

\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}

\hat{s} \\ \hat{\phi} \\ \hat{z}

\end{bmatrix} \qquad \begin{bmatrix}

\hat{s} \\ \hat{\phi} \\ \hat{z}

\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}

\cos\phi & \sin\phi & 0\\

-\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0\\

0 & 0 & 1

\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}

\hat{x}\\

\hat{y}\\

\hat{z}

\end{bmatrix}
$$

For triple integrals, the infinitesimal displacements are
$$
dl_s = ds,\qquad dl_\phi = sd\phi,\qquad dl_z = dz
$$
our volume element is
$$
d\tau = sds\;d\phi\;dz
$$
and line displacement is
$$
d\vec{l} = ds\hat{s} + sd\phi \hat{\phi} + dz\hat{z}
$$

# Dirac Delta Function

Imagine we have an infinite point mass at the origin, and it is the only thing in the universe.

![](images/chapter1/point-charge-at-zero.png)
The total mass of the universe must be just the mass of the point charge; but the point charge exists only at $(0,0,0)$, and is a *point charge* - it has no spatial dimension. If we were to integrate over the entire universe, we'd find we have just the mass of the point charge - and can mathematically represent that with the **Dirac delta function**. 

$$
\delta (x) = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } x\neq 0 \\
\infty & \text{if } x=0 
\end{cases}

$$
and
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x)\;dx = 1
$$
Therefore, if we have some continuous function $f(x)$ (could be a constant or a function, anything attached to $\delta(x)$).
$$
f(x)\delta(x) = \begin{cases}
0 &\text{if } x\neq 0\\
f(0) & \text{if }x = 0
\end{cases}
$$
which brings us to the neat and nice identity:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\delta(x-a)\;dx = f(a)
$$

## Dirac Delta in 2D, 3D

$$
\delta^3(\vec{r}) = \delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z)
$$

And, unsurprisingly,
$$
\int_{\text{all space}} f(\vec{r})\delta^3(\vec{r}-\vec{a})\;d\tau = f(\vec{a})
$$

> **Note on $\mathcal{R}$:** with $\mathcal{R}=\vec{r}-\vec{r'}$ (the separation vector), 
> $$ \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\mathcal{\vec{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2} \right) = 4\pi\delta^3(\vec{\mathcal{R}}) $$
> and
> $$ \nabla^2 \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}} = -4\pi\delta^3(\vec{\mathcal{R}}) $$
