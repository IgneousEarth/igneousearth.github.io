1. The **inner detector** detects the spatial distribution of the jet including:
	- **Pixel detector**: silicon pixels, almost like a CCD to measure energy of each beam (magnitude)
	- **Semiconductor tracker** (SCT): measures particle tracks (direction/position)
	- **Transition radiation tracker** (TRT): ionized gas to detect charged particles as they go through (electric charge)
	- Each layer provides information that reinforces each other - several methods to detect position, momentum and particle energy.
2. The **calorimeters** measure the energy of easily-stopped or easily-measured particles.
	1. **Liquid Argon calorimeter** (LAr): bosons, leptons and hadrons (i.e. photons and electrons) - metal "explodes" incident particles into a shower of new particles, absorbed by liquid argon.
	2. **Tile Hadronic calorimeter**: measures hadronic particles which might escape the LAr - hits steel tiles which "explode" remaining particles, plastic flashing (scintillating) tiles absorb light and emit photons depending on energy of particle.
3. **Magnets** - measure momentum and charge with E-fields. 
	1. **Central solenoid magnet** measures momentum of ions/charged particles (7.73 kiloamperes, 38 megajoules stored in magnetic field (2 teslas), 9 km of superconducting wire)
	2. **Toroid magnet** measures momentum of muons, three of these (one surrounding detector), two on ends of experiment
4. **Muon spectrometer** - muons are significantly heavier than electrons and tend to pass through the calorimeter.
	1. **Monitor drift tubes** (MDTs): 3 cm-wide aluminum tubes filled with gas, muons knock electrons (to "drift") into a central wire which conveys current to indicate muon presence.
	2. **Fast-Response Detectors**: gas-mixture tubes, decide whether a muon collision event is interesting or not

The Higgs boson itself has zero spin, no electric charge and no easy way to interact with most matter - also, it decays *very* quickly. However, it decays into particles we *can* detect, which include (but are not limited to):
- two photons
- two z-bosons
- two w-bosons
- a tau-antitau pair
- a bottom-antibottom pair
