# Stoic opposition

Patterson (p.264) identified two strains in Roman stoicism: *reactionary* and *reformist*.
- Patrician Stoicism, a reaction to contemporary politics
	- More influential under the Principate than the Republic
	- Tool for survival under the Principate
	- "Philosophy of consolation, life sucks under Nero"
	- Seneca, Epictetus 
- Reformist Stoicism, which could be a radical interpretation. 
	- Reforms of society at large

Manifested principally in writing and in the actions of a few individuals.
- Cato the Younger (see below)
- Brutus and Cassius were also heroized by the Stoics
- Thrasea Paetus below, opposed Nero (primary figure in stoic opposition)

## Wirszubski Ch. 5

- Principate & libertas were once considered contradictory but later were mixed.
- Stoic Opposition was not attempting to restore the Republic, but rather wanted the emperor to be more like Augustus, not Nero. 
	- See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_Opposition
- Socrates took his own life as he wouldn't admit he'd committed any crime - intellectual opposition to tyranny.
- Cato the Younger takes his own life while reading Plato's *Phaedo*
	- Posterchild for later Stoics - model of opposition to tyranny
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Younger#Final_campaign_and_death
	- "Caesar is said to have responded to his death by lamenting that Cato's death meant Caesar could not pardon him."
	- "After righting the city's financial accounts and disbursing the remaining monies to the city's inhabitants, Cato discussed with his friends at dinner the [Stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism") belief that a truly free man would never become a slave."
		- Wow. He seems a good man.

# *Libertas Senatus*

- "Freedom of the Senate" became important in the imperial period (perhaps as a counterpoint to Imperial power?)
- Last institutional link to the Roman Republic, became important / representative of the better elements of the old Republic
- Roman people never (generally) rebelled against the emperors
- Opposition to 'despotism' was confined to the senatorial class
- *Thrasea Paetus* (important to Tacitus/Wirszubski) senator who constantly opposed Nero in dramatic ways

# Exitus literature

**Exitus literature**: biographies of famous men that focus on their deaths ('exitus', generally by suicide), often Stoics, which were popular among the Stoic opposition. 
- Several biographies of Cato the Younger were in circulation for instance
- Tacitus' *Agricola* is one surviving text notably influenced by this genre
	- Tacitus himself never killed himself (though lived through 'bad emperor' Domitian's reign)
	- Agricola was father-in-law who was governor of Britain in 77 AD by Domitian, who later persecuted him out of paranoia
	- Agricola never took his own life despite imperial prosecution - Tacitus cited him as 'a great man under a bad emperor' (though Tacitus himself is of course biased). 

# Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD)

> Roman emperor, last of the Five Good Emperors

- Wrote *Meditations*, private reflections not intended for general publication.
	- Written in Greek (not Latin!), though contextually appropriate as *Meditations* covered a lot of originally Greek philosophy.
	- Reflections: who knows why he wrote them, but in my mind I wonder if they weren't written as reminders. Here are things that are important for myself to remember in the future.
- Wrote about how he had learned much from many of the Stoic Opposition figures (Dr. Bringman: interesting particularly given that he himself was an emperor, the very figures many of the Stoic Opposition folks tended to oppose).
