# Lecture 13 - Religion and Rome

Regarding **separation of church and state**:
- Romans might have viewed this very concept as absurd
- "Religion" had a very different connotation to everyday Romans - all sorts of religious phenomena existed as part of everyday life.
	- How can any aspect of life escape being included in the gods' providence? ... no significant decisions in life unaffected by religion. 
- (p. 128) nobody may have private gods unless brought in officially, or ancestral gods worshipped in private.
	- Should be state-sanctioned gods
- Roman religion generally quite practical, not spiritual.
	- Intellectuals often became very attached to mystery religions

Bacchanalia affair: more a suppression of a *social phenomenon* than religious repression.

> **Trajan**: as long as suspected Christians openly worship the Roman gods, we don't care too much about their past activity. 

# Patterson 187-190: Free Will / Epicurianism

> Epicurianism: a more wholesome version of hedonism. Pleasure is the ultimate good, but not in the sense of indulgence - pursue freedom from pain through moderation, simple living and strong friendships.

- Epicurus on free will: without free will, freedom arguments are moot. 
	- Take away free will, and there is no impetus to do anything at all.
- Morality is impossible without free will - how can we condemn a person whose actions are predetermined by necessity/fate?
- World without free will is *sociologically impossible* per Patterson.
- Epicurus: *natural to be free*. 
- Human freedom is distinct in being chosen freedom. 

# Augustine

Born **354 AD** in Thagaste (Souk Ahras, Algeria), about 150 miles inland from Tunis

- Berber (North African) ethnicity
	- given name: Aurelius Augustinus
	- Mother: Monica, a Christian
	- Father: pagan

11: educated at Madaura. 17: educated in Carthage. 15 year relationship with a low-status Carthaginian woman.
- Ended relationship to become engaged to wealthy young woman ... 
- Then *ended* that relationship to become a Christian
- Wrote *Confessions*

**Augustine**: free will is an important topic in a theological context, free will explains the existence of evil.
- Argument: why does evil exist if God is all-powerful? 
- Free will given to man because man cannot do anything without it (good *or* evil) without it
	- Given free will to use in favor of good not evil
	- If man uses free will for evil, then he is responsible for his actions and is justly punished by God
