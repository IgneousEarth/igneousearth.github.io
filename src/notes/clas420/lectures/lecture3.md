# Lecture 3

Titus Livius (Livy) wrote *History of Rome* in 142 books, 35 of which still survive to today, which sought to detail Rome's history from it's founding in 753 BC to the death of Drusus in 9 BC. 

753: Founded by Romulus and Remus. 
509: Tarquin overthrown; Republic established.
264-241: First Punic War
218-201: Second Punic War
149-146: Third Punic War, Carthage destroyed.
133: Tiberius Gracchus assassinated
54: *De Republica* (The Republic)
44: Caesar assasinated
31: Octavian defeats Antony to become Rome's sole ruler
27: Octavian renamed Augustus, Rome becomes a monarchy (though Romans don't call it as such, the Greeks are honest about it).

## Cicero and Plato's Republic

- Plato was high-level and abstract in *Republic*
- Plato was also the high-level Greek author the Romans tended to learn from.
	- Romans would call the Greeks great, *except* for at Politics, within which the Romans outdid them.
	- Cicero likely would have disagreed about Plato's ideas on freedom. 

# Regarding Cicero

106 BC: born in Arpinum on Jan. 3
63 BC: Becomes a Roman Consul. Quashes Cataline's Conspiracy, making him rather popular within the ruling class.
58 BC: exiled by the tribune Clodius Pulcher
57 BC: Recalled at the behest of Pompey (general, statesman) at the behest of Milo (political agitator).
51-50 BC: made governor of Cilicia, sacked 'some stronghold of rebels' called Pindenissum.
49 BC: half-heartedly sided with the Pompeians during the Roman Civil War.
47 BC: Cicero returns to Rome and receives pardon from Caesar
44-43 BC: delivered 14 *Philippics* (oratics/denouncements) against the consul Mark Antony.
43 BC: proscribed by the Triumvirate and beheaded.

## Education

- Student of Philo of Larissa, the Academy of Plato's final scholarch. Came to Rome in 87 BC. 
- Principally an Academic Skeptic, but in adherence to that was not dogmatic about it, 'heard out' other schools of thought. 

## *De Re Publica*

> Republic = *libertas* (not ruled by kings)

- *De Re Publica* is first installment of his own political philosophy works.
- Acted as a justification of the Roman Republic by writing a Roman version of Plato's republic.
	- Conceptualization of the Platonic ideal of Rome. 
- Mostly lost to time, only fragments survive.
- Book 2: Scipio points out that Rome was a *very* long time in the making.
	- Constitution (political system) in Latin is *res publica*. Denotes things that collectively concern political life.  

## Enter: ze Kings

- Numa (2nd king): introduces serious religion in Rome.
	- Cicero: religion and humane behavior allow state to survive
- Cicero notes Greek influences are positive wrt Roman education
- Ancus Marcus - state leapt forward in culture when Greek philosophy and art are combined with Roman politics and warfare.
- Lucius Tarquinius: First Etruscan king. 
	- Things start going bad.
- Servius Tullius (*servus* means slave?), adopted son of Tarquinius I.
	- Reformed Roman politics, reorganizing population, distributing them into new groups so wealthy could hold power. Democracy is dangerous. 
	- Servius' system is the foundation upon which the upcoming Republic was built. 
- Cicero: monarchy is the enemy of freedom. A just tyrant is still a tyrant. 
- Tarquin the Proud/Arrogant: kills Servius, becomes tyrant.
	- Tarquin (son-in-law) and Tullia (younger daughter of Servius)
- Cicero: a successful state needs a little freedom but not too much. A good statesman should be practical. 

## Regarding Livy

- Augustan-era writer (Octavian renamed to Augustus) who lived during times of extreme political change in Rome.
- "What happens to a society that abandons its moral compass?"
- Livy names Augustus three times, seeming to like him but implying criticisms certain acts of his.
- Book 1: monarchy period is a collection of 'fables'. 
- Implied Servius might have ended the monarchy
- Tends to be rather dramatic, likes to imagine history as almost a Greek tragedy.

509 BC: monarchy ostensibly ends. Livy's books tend to become more historical than dramatic from this point. 

## Overthrow of the Monarchy

- Tarquin made large unpopular public works projects, forcing Roman citizens to labor at these.
- Sextus Tarquinius (son of Tarquin) violates Lucretia (Collatinius' wife). She summons her father, husband and tells them of it, then commits suicide.
	- Sextus is awful. 
- Monarchy is summarily overthrown afterward. 
- Revolution led by Lucius Junius Brutus (Brutis = stupid, cultivated name but obviously not accurate), king replaced by consuls. 
	- Consul's oath of office says they wouldn't be a king, Livy's Brutus' speech includes language used in the oath.
- Brutus: hero insofar as he removed a tyrant. Would have been wicked/bad to remove Servius. 
- Cicero: Roman Republic was only successful because it developed over a long period of time.
