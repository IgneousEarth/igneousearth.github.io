## Concepts and conceptions

- **Concepts**: universal, abstract idea that captures some 'essential meaning' of something.
	- Universal: applies to all instances of a type.
	- Abstract: no concrete particularities (time, place, context).
	- Essential: core, unchanging feature of a thing that makes it what it is. 
- **Conception**: specific articulation or interpretation of a concept - almost like 'applied concepts'. Context, circumstance, intent is applied to a concept. 

> **i.e. Justice** (see *Theory of Justice* by John Rawls): all men have a conception of justice - however, many of these conceptions disagree with one another. Thus, the *concept of justice is distinct from the various conceptions of justice*.

# Freedom

- Is it universal (single timeless meaning)? Does it depend on context?
- Is it positive ("freedom to")? Or negative ("freedom from")?
- Individual, collectives, or both?
- Is it a feeling? Quality? State of being? Measurable condition? Tied to accountability or independent of obligations to others? 
- Where does it come from? Innate right? 
- What is its opposition?
- Why does it matter? 
- Is it fundamentally good?

We have numerous conceptions of freedom: Stoicism's 'freedom of the mind', Christianity's freedom from sin and death, Hobbesian social contract (naturally free but surrenders some freedom to government for self-preservation). Lockean liberalism (life, liberty, property), Kantian autonomy (self-legislation).

## Re: Orlando Patterson and his *Freedom*

- Jamaican-American sociologist whose scholarship focuses on slavery and race in the Americas.
- Published *Slavery and Social Death* in 1982 (slaves are a 'type of death' (social death)). 
- 1991 - published "*Freedom: Volume I: Freedom In The Making Of Western Culture*".
	- Examines freedom in opposition to slavery, argues that slavery is crucial in generating the *valuation* of freedom as an *ideal* uniquely in Western civilization.
	- **Q**: Freedom exists as a dichotomy with slavery? I.e. slavery conceptualizes freedom? 

Has four questions in the intro:
1. How and why was freedom initially **constructed as a social value**?
2. How and why did it emerge as *the* premiere and supreme value distinct from any other potentially equally important values?
3. Why did this rise to culturally supremacy happen *only in the Western world*, and why for so many centuries remain confined to Western civilization?
4. Having achieved preeminence, what forces maintained its status as the core value of Western civilization? 

**Note**: Patterson defines 'Western world' as Greece, Rome, western Europe.

> Analyzes freedom as a sociologist and historian, seeking to understand how freedom was conceived of (and valued by) people in historical societies. *Not* a philosopher in this context - doesn't seek a 'true definition' of freedom. 

### Patterson's Conception of Freedom

Calls it a "chordal triad".

- **Personal freedom**: autonomy to act as one pleases, free from undue restraint, conditioned by respect for others' rights. 
- **Sovereignal freedom**: *power* to act as one pleases, regardless of the wishes of others. (Associated with those who have power over other individuals). 
- **Civic freedom**: capacity of adult members of some community to participate within that community and make meaningful decisions regarding its operation.

# Dr. Joseph Bringman: What Freedom Is

Somewhat self-deprecatingly, Dr. Bringman hence declares the below to be the definition of freedom:

> **Freedom**: "the rational capacity of a being to direct itself toward its proper good through deliberate choice."

- *Rational capacity*: freedom requires *reason*, distinguishing it from instinct or necessity.
- *Self-direction*: active power of self-motivation, rooted in the will. 
- *Proper good*: aims at a certain end (e.g. flourishing - called *eudaimonia* by Aristotle).
- *Deliberate choice*: freedom is an intentional decision. 

Other "sub"-conceptions of freedom:

**Volitional conception**: "the rational capacity of the soul to direct itself toward the universal good through deliberate choice."
- Proper good is the person's ultimate end, and the focus is internal - the will's power to choose among 'Goods' presented by the intellect. 
- Often called 'freedom of will' or 'free will'.

**Social freedom**: "the rational capacity of a person to direct themself toward the common good through deliberate choice within a community."
- Proper good is the flourishing of society (i.e. justice, peace) and the conflict is external.
- Presupplies free will, applies it to a life in human society.
- Not just a legal status - the capacity of a person to participate in society.
- "Slave" vs "free person". 
- This is a *spectrum*.

**Political freedom** / **Moral freedom**

**Spiritual freedom**: "the rational capacity of a person, perfected by divine grace, to direct themself toward union with God through deliberate choice."
- Proper good is divine communion. 
- Grace elevates the will's natural capacity to overcome the distortions of sin.
- Fullest expression of freedom.
