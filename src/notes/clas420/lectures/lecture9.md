# Lecture 9 - Cynics

> I missed a few lectures prior to this one.

# Cynicism

Greek-origin philosophical system which lacked any institutional equivalent of Plato's academy, but generally concentrated on three issues:

1. **Nature**: live in accord with human nature by realizing "people are reasoning animals", rejecting arbitrary conventions of society. 
2. **Virtue**: achieved by following one's natural sense of reason, living simply and shamelessly free from social constraints.
	- Only goal of human life, only thing needed for inner happiness.
	- Wealth, status, honor is pointless/irrelevant. 
3. **Freedom**: self-sufficient, reject wealth, pomp and other conventional values. Being above social conventions / unconstrained by interactions with society. 

## Diogenes the Cynics

One of the more famous cynics.

- Born in Sinope (412-323 BC)
- Eventually landed in Athens and became student of Antisthenes (pupil of Socrates), from whom he learned quite a lot
- Scion of a wealthy family, but embraced poverty and simplicity. 
	- Spurned all social conventions, great and small, not caring that he offended people.
	- Some liked his eccentricity, others of course did not. 

Diogenes did not like Plato (and the feeling was quite mutual). 

"Looking for a man" while strolling through the agora. 

Later captured by pirates, enslaved in Corinth. While there, he taught Crates of Thebes, who later taught Zeno of Citium (founder of Stoicism). 


# Stoicism

Stoicism was a branch of philosophy which later emerged from cynicism. 

- Focused on the importance of living in accordance with nature. 
- Common humanity of everyone regardless of nationality, sex or condition of servitude (slaves just as human as monarchs). 
	- Did *not* advocate abolition of slavery, but did urge humane treatment as fellow humans.
- Developed theories of natural law. 
- Cicero articulated his own views on natural law which greatly influenced later thinkers (U.S. Declaration of Independence). 

## Virtue

- Virtue *alone* is good, whereas vice is the only evil.
- Both necessary and sufficient to make one happy.
	- The pursuit of which is sufficient.
- Differs from other philosophical schools, such as Platonists and Aristotelians who considered virtue to be the chief, but not exclusive, good (ditto vice). 
- To the Stoics: virtue is all-or-nothing. No half-assing. Either perfectly virtuous or viceful. 

> Virtue and vice is within one's own agency, and we have the ability to enact change within it.

However, things exist external to virtue and vice. 
- Wealth, health, poverty, illness are morally indifferent / external. 
- We can't affect them. Of course, wealth/heath generally positive, illness/poverty generally negative. 

> **Stoics**: virtue or vice is within one's own control whereas everything else is not, so for the Stoics good and evil is solely concerned with what is in our control / agency.

## Freedom

- Stoics appreciated political freedom, put emphasis on spiritual freedom (i.e. ruling one's passions rather than vice versa = freedom from passions). 
- **Epictetus** (50-135 CE), who was born into slavery, expounded the doctrine that slavery to one's passions was a worse evil than bodily slavery.
	- Agency and ability to change. 

# Epictetus

> c. 50-135 CE

- Greek man born into slavery in Hierapolis
- Name means "acquired"
- Ended up in Rome, sold to Epaphroitus (freedman, secretary, and suicide-assistant of Nero)
- Allowed to study philosophy under Musonius Rufus, noted Roman Stoic
- Freed sometime after Nero's death (~68 CE)
- Taught philosophy in Rome until c. 93 CE, until Emperor Domitian banished all philosophers
	- Why???
- Moved to Nicopolis, where he founded a school of philosophy and taught (among others) Arrian, who wrote down teachings.

## *Discourse* on Freedom

- Unique text on freedom from the Roman period
- One of the few writers with a surviving work who was himself also a slave at some point (first ~20 years of life)

**Questions**:

Who are the free and who are the slaves?
- The wicked? No - sorrows, envy, etc.
- Animals? Perhaps - but do they enjoy being cooped up?
- Servitium amoris (slavery of love) - no, bound to the person one loves

Who is a slave?
- If you are compelled to do something, you are a slave. 
- To free oneself from compulsion, death.

# Servile Wars

The Servile Wars were a series of three large slave revolts.

- The first two localized to Sicily (135-132, 104-100 BCE)
	- Both involved slave leaders who declared themselves kings

The largest of the three, however, was led by **Spartacus**.

# Spartacus

- Thracian man who served as a soldier alongside the Romans, before he was enslaved by aforementioned Romans.
- No eyewitness or contemporary accounts of him exist; best sources, Appian and Plutarch's *Life of Crassus*, written centuries after events.
	- Thus, we know effectively nothing of him apart from his participation in the Third Servile War. 
- Spartacus and a bunch of enslaved gladiators escaped to the countryside and sought to recover their freedom.
	- What type of freedom? From slavery? Back to homeland?

---

- Either instigator or later chosen leader after revolt.
- Soon after escaping, band swells (slaves, fugitives, even free farmers joined up), army swelled to 100,000+ strong, moving up and down the Italian countryside.
	- Managed to defeat several Roman armies.
- Romans initially dismissive of revolt, then frantically attempted to stop revolt after realizing how successful it was.
- Crassus himself got command of a Roman army, defeated Spartacus's army (with Pompey coming in near the end to 'help out')
- Spartacus and all his soldiers were crucified.
	- Final major slave revolt in Roman history.
