## Arrival

Acquired copious amounts of soda from Fred Meyer due to a bizarre buy-two-get-three deal. Arrived at MRO around 7:00 PM, skies clearing up from earlier rain, mid-50s temperature - hoping for clear skies tonight. 

**Checklist notes**: Water level in tank after turning on the pump at 20% - refill next time. 

## Night - Fri. May 24

**Notes**:
- Always use the target list to start slewing. Make sure telescope is able to slew from Vega to Arcturus. 
- Started the night aligning the finder scope with the 0.8m.
- Started observations around 3:30 AM - see problems log below. 
- Nonlabeled flats are sky flats - domeflats are indicated such in header
	- Wrote bash script to take domeflats automatically

 **Problems**:
- Focus issues early on that we worked on until midnight - emergency stop of [Bifrost](https://github.com/UWMRO/TCS) software meant we lost track of current focus position. Eventually reset.
- Slewing / connection issues with Bifrost
- DUST - see ecam-83
- Same dust particles different filters? ... filter may not have moved or dust on CCDs.

## Sat. May 25 - Day

Forgot to disable tracking while doing domeflats - telescope slewed entire night. Spent morning re-acquiring domeflats. 

Pulled off CCD to see if dust effects were on it.

| **Dusty darling**                      | **Better**                             |
