# Replacing the valves on an N14 Mini Cooper

> I have a 2012 Mini Cooper Clubman with the [N14 engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_engine) (known as the 'Prince engine') that recently lost compression in cylinder 1 while driving on the highway. 
> After doing some diagnostics work with an endoscope probe and compression testing, I found that I likely had some bent valves.
